# Browser Use Cloud & OpenAI Setup

The system now supports **Browser Use Cloud** as an alternative to local browsers and Browserbase, specifically designed to work from Sri Lanka and other regions with access restrictions.

## What is Browser Use Cloud?

Browser Use Cloud is a cloud browser automation service that provides:
- Live preview URLs for real-time viewing
- Browser automation via REST API
- No geographic restrictions (accessible from Sri Lanka)
- Integrated screenshot and recording capabilities

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get API Keys

You need two API keys:
- **OpenAI API Key**: Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and create a new API key
- **Browser Use Cloud API Key**: Visit the Browser Use Cloud website and sign up for an account

### 2. Configure API Keys

Edit your `.env` file and set both API keys:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration for ChatGPT-4o mini
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here

# Browser Use Cloud Configuration
BROWSER_USE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_actual_browser_use_cloud_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test the Integration

Run the test scripts to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Test OpenAI integration
python test_openai_integration.py

# Test Browser Use Cloud integration
python test_browser_use_cloud.py
```

If successful, you should see:
```
✅ LangChain ChatOpenAI response: Hello! How can I help you today?
✅ Browser-Use ChatOpenAI initialized successfully
✅ Browser Use Cloud manager initialized successfully
✅ Task created successfully!
```

### 4. Start the Application

Once configured, start the application normally:

```bash
python main.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:8002/interactive` to use the interactive browser interface.

## How It Works

1. **Task Creation**: When you submit a browser task, it creates a cloud browser session
2. **AI Processing**: ChatGPT-4o mini analyzes your request and plans the automation steps
3. **Live View**: You get a live preview URL embedded in the interface  
4. **Real-time Interaction**: Chat with the AI while viewing the browser automation
5. **Results**: Get task completion status, screenshots, and AI-generated summaries

## Benefits

- ✅ **ChatGPT-4o mini**: Fast, intelligent browser automation with OpenAI's latest model
- ✅ **Geographic Access**: Works from Sri Lanka and other restricted regions
- ✅ **No Local Issues**: No browser crashes or configuration problems
- ✅ **Live Preview**: Real-time browser automation viewing
- ✅ **Interactive Chat**: Collaborate with AI during automation
- ✅ **Screenshot Collection**: Automatic documentation of all steps
- ✅ **AI Summaries**: Intelligent task completion analysis

## Fallback Options

The system maintains three browser options in order of preference:

1. **Browser Use Cloud** (Primary - for geographic accessibility)
2. **Browserbase** (Secondary - for advanced features)
3. **Local Browser** (Fallback - for development/testing)

The system will automatically use the first available option based on your configuration.
