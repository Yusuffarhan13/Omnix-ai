# Browser Automation with Research Integration

## Overview
The browser automation mode now intelligently detects when research is needed and automatically uses the Perplexity Sonar Deep Research API before executing browser tasks. This provides more informed and accurate browser automation.

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Research Detection**
When a browser task is submitted, the system checks for research-related keywords:
- "research"
- "find out"
- "look up"
- "search for"
- "what is"
- "how to"
- "information about"
- "learn about"

### 2. **Research Process**
If research is needed:
1. The system notifies: **"üîç Using researcher mode to research and find answers..."**
2. Perplexity performs deep research across multiple sources
3. Research results are integrated into the browser task
4. The system notifies: **"‚úÖ Research completed. Analyzed X sources. Now executing browser task..."**

### 3. **Enhanced Browser Execution**
The browser agent receives:
- Original task description
- Comprehensive research summary
- List of credible sources to prioritize
- Relevant URLs to visit

## Examples

### Example 1: Research and Browse
**User Input:** "Research and find the latest AI news on TechCrunch"

**System Process:**
1. Detects "research" keyword
2. Shows: "üîç Using researcher mode to research and find answers..."
3. Researches latest AI news using Perplexity
4. Shows: "‚úÖ Research completed. Analyzed 25 sources. Now executing browser task..."
5. Browser navigates to TechCrunch with knowledge of what to look for

### Example 2: Information Lookup
**User Input:** "Look up information about quantum computing and visit IBM's quantum page"

**System Process:**
1. Detects "look up" and "information about" keywords
2. Researches quantum computing comprehensively
3. Provides browser with context about quantum computing
4. Browser efficiently navigates to IBM's quantum page with understanding

### Example 3: Tutorial Search
**User Input:** "Find Python tutorials and open the best one"

**System Process:**
1. Detects "find" keyword
2. Researches current best Python tutorials
3. Provides browser with ranked list of quality tutorials
4. Browser opens the most recommended tutorial

## Benefits

1. **Informed Browsing**: Browser knows what to look for before navigating
2. **Efficient Navigation**: Prioritizes credible sources from research
3. **Better Results**: Combines research intelligence with browser automation
4. **Time Saving**: Avoids random browsing by targeting specific sources
5. **Context Awareness**: Browser understands the topic before acting

## Status Messages

The system provides clear feedback during the process:

| Status | Message | Meaning |
|--------|---------|---------|
| üîç | "Using researcher mode to research and find answers..." | Research has started |
| ‚úÖ | "Research completed. Analyzed X sources. Now executing browser task..." | Research done, browser starting |
| üåê | "Browser task started successfully" | Browser is now executing |
| üì∏ | "Taking screenshot" | Browser is capturing current state |
| ‚úì | "Task completed" | Both research and browsing finished |

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Research
Research is automatically enabled when:
- Perplexity API key is configured in `.env`
- Task contains research-related keywords

### API Requirements
```env
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here
```

## Technical Details

### Research Integration Flow
```python
1. Task submitted to /browser endpoint
2. execute_browser_use_cloud_task() checks for research keywords
3. If needed, calls enhanced_research_manager.conduct_research_sync()
4. Research results enhance task description
5. Browser executes with enriched context
```

### Socket.IO Events
- `task_step` with `action: 'research_start'` - Research beginning
- `task_step` with `action: 'research_complete'` - Research finished
- `task_step` with `action: 'browser_cloud_start'` - Browser starting

## Limitations

1. Research adds 10-30 seconds to task start time
2. Requires valid Perplexity API key
3. Research is only triggered by specific keywords
4. May use API credits for each research query

## Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
python test_browser_research.py
```

This will:
1. Submit browser tasks with research keywords
2. Show status updates
3. Verify research integration works

## Troubleshooting

### Research Not Triggering
- Check if task contains research keywords
- Verify PERPLEXITY_API_KEY is set correctly
- Check Flask server logs for errors

### Browser Not Using Research
- Ensure research completes before browser starts
- Check if enhanced_task_description is being passed
- Verify browser agent receives the enriched context

### No Status Messages
- Check Socket.IO connection
- Verify frontend is listening for task_step events
- Check browser console for errors

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Detection**: AI-based detection of when research is needed
2. **Caching**: Cache research results for similar queries
3. **Selective Research**: Research only specific aspects of a task
4. **Multi-step Research**: Research at different stages of browsing
5. **Visual Context**: Use screenshots to inform follow-up research
